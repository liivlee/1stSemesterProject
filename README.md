# 1stSemesterProject

Project idea: Interactive portfolio website!!
What?! How?! Here's how!:
1. Learn
   Right now, I don't have the skills needed to make a high-quality interactive website.
   So! I'm going to start a course to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
2. Make
   After learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I am going to make the website!
   But before actually making it, I will have to plan out my plan!
   a) Plan
     Brainstorm what I'm going to have on my website(animations, features, etc.)
   b) Actually make it
3. Submit my amazing and beautiful project to the D128 STEAM Showcase!
