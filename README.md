# 1stSemesterProject

Project idea: Interactive portfolio website!!
What?! How?! Here's how!:
1. Research/Learn
   Right now, I don't have the skills needed to make a high-quality interactive website.
   So! I'm going to start a course to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
   This is the course I will be taking: https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-development
2. Make
   After learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I am going to make the website!
