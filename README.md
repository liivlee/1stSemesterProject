# 1stSemesterProject

Project idea: Interactive portfolio website!!
What?! How?! Here's how!:
1. Research/Learn
   Right now, I don't have the skills needed to make a high-quality interactive website.
   So! I'm going to start a course to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
   This is the course I will be taking: https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-development
2. Make
   After learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I am going to make the website!

3. Submit my amazing and beautiful project to the D128 STEAM Showcase!

Learning plan: I will be taking a course on Codeacademy.

Progress Tracking:
Week 4: Completed 16% of the course
   Elements
   1. Element content: information between the opening and closing tags of an element. (ex. <h1>Hello world</h1>, "Hello world" is the element)
   2. Types of content: list, video, image, heading, paragraph, etc.
   Structure
   1. HTML follows a family tree structure(parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, etc.)
   2. Syntax: opening tag(<h1>) + content + closing tag(</h1>) (ex. <h1>Hello world</h1>)
   3. Indentation matters
   4. Use (<!--) and (-->) to comment (ex. <!--hi-->)

Week 5: Completed 17% of the course(33% total)

During week 4 and 5, I made a website about bears! I learned how to add a title, paragraph, list, image, video, link websites, etc.


Week 6: Completed course on Code Academy, did research to gather resources to start making my website

I will be using three.js to make cool animations for my website
What is three.js? Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.
